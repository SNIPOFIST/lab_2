INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of google-generativeai to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested google-ai-generativelanguage==0.7.0
    google-generativeai 0.7.2 depends on google-ai-generativelanguage==0.6.6

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
